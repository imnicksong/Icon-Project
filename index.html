        <p>For all the songs written about its urban grandeur, New York is infamous for its lack of available restrooms. The Big Apple has just 1,100 public restrooms available for its 8.5 million residents — a ratio of fewer than 1 toilet per 10,000 people. The nation’s most densely populated American city is <a href="https://nationwidewasteservice.com/the-best-and-worst-u-s-cities-for-public-toilets/" target="_blank">ranked 30th</a> in terms of bathroom availability amongst all United States cities. And that doesn’t factor the tens of millions of tourists that flow through New York’s streets each year.</p>
        <br><p>New Yorkers may instinctively blame the current mayor for the issue, but the bathroom shortage has been present in the city for half a century (possible reasons include <a href="https://urbandesignforum.org/the-need-for-public-bathrooms-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank">city budgetary cuts in the 1970s</a> and a <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/a-pay-toilet-opens-no-need-to-hold-everything/" target="_blank">1975 state law banning pay toilets</a>). With the shortage of toilets still widespread, knowing where the public toilets are in the city separates the transplants from the true-blue New Yorkers.</p>
        <br><p>Many people have sought to collect that knowledge and share it amongst the masses over the years. Those efforts have gotten easier in the digital age. For those who need to find a toilet in a pinch — or just want to follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuePe_-6C80" target="_blank">the footsteps of George Costanza</a> — here are some of the best resources available to help you locate the closest restroom in NYC.</p>

        <h3 class="sectionHeading">Early Book Guides</h3>
        <p>People began making bathroom guides to New York in the mid-20th century. In 1966, Jonathan Routh published <a href="https://transpontinebooks.com/products/the-better-john-guide-to-new-york" target="_blank"><i>The Better John Guide: Where to Go in New York.</i></a> The 126-page book was itself a spinoff from Routh’s original “Good Loo Guide” booklet, detailing toilets around London. <br><br>Other guides followed suit. In 1984, Lana Toni Gersman published her own unrelated guide, <a href="https://www.biblio.com/9780943392400" target="_blank"><i>Dear John: A Guide to the Best Seats in New York</a></i>. Freelance computer programmer Vicki Rovere wrote <i><a href="https://nypost.com/2001/08/07/way-to-go-authors-nyc-toilet-book-flush-with-information/" target="_blank">Where to Go: A Guide to Manhattan’s Toilets</a></i> in 2001.<br><br>The already-niche genre of NYC bathroom guidebooks has largely fallen out of practice — with the occassional self-published Amazon ebook being published. Still, the guides set a benchmark for the next generation of bathroom resources to reach and surpass.</p>

                <p>One of the earliest notable websites set up to track NYC restrooms, the website was created by Wansoo Im — a professor at Rutgers University specializing in geographic information systems (GIS). The project began in the early 2000s. Unlike predecessors before it, the website served as an open-source guide where anyone could add new bathrooms and update information.</p>

Her first post was a PSA about the unlocked bathroom located on the second floor of the Times Square McDonald's. Siegel expanded the account to rate and recommend public restrooms around the city. Later, she created a shared Google Map of public restrooms around New York. The map includes directions for inside stores and codes for accessing bathrooms.</p>

The map includes restrooms affiliated with the Parks Department, the Department of Transportation, the MTA, the library system, and privately owned public spaces. The "Ur in Luck" initiative included legislation to build 46 new restrooms and renovate 36 preexisting bathrooms around the city.</p>

        <p>In July 2025, the New York City Council passed <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-public-bathrooms-new-law/#:~:text=NYC%20looking%20to%20nearly%20double,one%20for%20every%204%2C050%20residents" target="_blank">Local Law 58</a> to address the shortage of public restrooms. The legislation mandates the creation of at least 2,120 new public restrooms, with half of them being publicly owned and operated. The initiative will identify sites that could be used for public restrooms. The Deputy Mayor in charge of the project will also submit a design model for a bathroom facility that’s compliant with city requirements.</p>
